# Initialize a variable weather with a string value being 'sunny', 'rainy', 
# or whatever weather condition you choose. Then, write an if statement that prints:

weather = 'rainy'

if weather == 'sunny':
    print('It\'s a beautiful day!')
elif weather == 'rainy':
    print('Grab your umbrella.')
else:
    print('Let\'s stay inside.')
